It is crucial to maintaining the original phrase or sentence and ensure accuracy while utilizing the appropriate language. The text is as follows:  ðŸ”¤ ${Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made tremendous progress in generating complicated scenes based on texts. However, human-object interaction (HOI) often cannot be precisely generated by current T2V models due to the lack of large-scale videos with accurate captions for HOI. To address this issue, we introduce HOIGen-1M, the first largescale dataset for HOI Generation, consisting of over one million high-quality videos collected from diverse sources. In particular, to guarantee the high quality of videos, we first design an efficient framework to automatically curate HOI videos using the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and then the videos are further cleaned by human annotators. Moreover, to obtain accurate textual captions for HOI videos, we design a novel video description method based on a Mixture-of-Multimodal-Experts (MoME) strategy that not only generates expressive captions but also eliminates the hallucination by individual MLLM. Furthermore, due to the lack of an evaluation framework for generated HOI videos, we propose two new metrics to assess the quality of generated videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments reveal that current T2V models struggle to generate high-quality HOI videos and confirm that our HOIGen-1M dataset is instrumental for improving HOI video generation.
